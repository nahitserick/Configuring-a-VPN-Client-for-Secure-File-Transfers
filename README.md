## Key Takeaways
This lab provided practical experience in configuring VPN clients and understanding secure vs. non-secure file transfers. The hands-on tasks with Windows VPN client setup, PowerShell configuration, and Wireshark analysis emphasized the importance of VPNs for secure communications. Comparing FTP and SSH traffic highlighted the vulnerabilities of non-secure protocols and the advantages of using encrypted channels for data transfer. This lab reinforced the critical skills needed for configuring and securing VPN connections in a professional environment.
